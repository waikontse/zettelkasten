# Description

My personal zettelkasten about the things I come across on my journeys. For me, it's more like a mindmap but with words instead of a graph.

# Why

Thre reason why I started to put this all on "paper" is because
1. I want to keep my brain power to work on things at hand and not struggling to remember stuff.
2. I want to create my personal web of knowledge where I can link all these information to make sense out of them.
3. My own way to expand my little circle of knowledge and comfor zones.

# My setup

1. Zetllr to write my zettelkasten articles
2. github to store and share my zettelkasten
3. Emacs bindings FTW!
